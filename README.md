# Dragons

Psuedo-realistic load generator for web servers. gevent is leveraged for high concurrency and boto (AWS / EC2) to for web scale expansion.

This project is very young and under heavy development. We are striving towards a stable alpha interface.

## Features

* Load is generated by simple workflows that resemble Finite State Machines.
* Workflows are stored in a dragonfile, separate from server configuration details. This is a design choice to decouple the logic and configuration.
* Access to the underlying HTTP client permits rich interactions (ie. cookies).

## Usage

### Development

After cloning the repo and installing dependencies (requirements.txt), do:
- "cd path/to/dragons/repo"
- "cp examples/example.py dragonfile.py"
- tweak the contents of dragonfile.py to your liking
- "python dragons/main.py -h" for basic help
- "python dragons/main.py run -h" for basic help on running dragon locally

## TODO

* Add EC2 instance creation / termination
* Decide how to install Dragons onto a remote EC2 instance
* Fix setup.py; geventhttpclient is not available in repos yet.
